Backgrounds
Adds 9 backgrounds for test mode.
Sounds in these backgrounds change dynamically as you transition between them.
+1 background if you enable the "Instant Transition spore" or "spaceStation" option—this background will have a shadow.
Instant transitions "u96," "elevator," and "fan" disable music during the cell stage in test mode.
To change music in the editor, enter test mode and then return to the editor.
Adds music to the Sporepedia for plants.
All Instant Transitions (IT) reduce ambient noise in the Air Vehicles and Cell to Creature editors, except for "IT default."
Glow
Works when the "Backgrounds" option is enabled.
Adds a glow effect to creatures and the environment, depending on the contrast between the creature and the background.
Effect created by RamoneKemono.
Instant Transition
Works when the "Backgrounds" option is enabled.
Allows for fast switching between selected backgrounds.
Also functions in the Cell to Creature stage.
To enable it in the Cell stage, you need the mod Choclce75 TestDrive.
Main Feature of the Mod
Instant Transition provides access to backgrounds in test mode for the following stages:
Cell
Cell to Creature
Tribal
Civilization
Space
Captain
Also works in the regular editor.
Issues
Some background lighting may not work immediately—switch to another background to fix it.
This issue adds variety to the backgrounds.
Do not click on the background icon you just switched to; select another one first.
If you do click it, you won’t be able to switch backgrounds anymore.
Fix: Exit and re-enter the editor.
This issue does not occur with the "Instant Transition default" option.
Mod Conflicts
This mod conflicts with mods that:

Add DNA.

Remove the part limit on creatures.

Add manipulators from Captain parts.

Change the editor background.

Change the editor music.

All Instant Transition options add 80,000 DNA, remove limits, and add manipulators.

The "u96" and "fan" options change the editor background and music (8 different tracks available).

Cursor
Changes the cursor.
Fully disables Instant Transition and the ability to access all backgrounds in any game stage.
This option helps avoid conflicts with other mods while keeping "Backgrounds" and "Glow" functional.
Need both the cursor and the options it disables?
After enabling the "Cursor" option, copy the file "!!!OSM_Cursor.package" from the DataEP1 folder and save it.
Install all other options.
Then, copy "!!!OSM_Cursor.package" back into DataEP1 like a regular mod.
After making changes in the launcher, the "!!!OSM_Cursor.package" mod will disappear.
The mod does not affect saves or game progression after making changes in the launcher.
Tip: If you didn’t know—right-click at the very top of the launcher for extra options.
It should work on all Spore ModAPI Launcher Kit versions.

Have fun playing! :)
