This mod allows you to play with the MIGHTIEST archetype ever, which replaces Wanderer's archetype. 
It has no unique superpower, but it has an unique thing - it has EVERY passive consequence ability from pre-Space stages (so you don't have to do evolution run :P)

Also:

-The Almighty archetype has Fanatical Frenzy ability
-Drastically reduces Fanatical Frenzy cooldown to 10 seconds (yeah, it is applicable to Zealots too .w.)
-New chat background
-[OPTIONAL] Infinite uses of every tool and possibility to use them on every planet
-[OPTIONAL] Possibility to buy other archetypes' abilities FOR ONE SPORE SESSION*
-[OPTIONAL] You can have Zealot's voice to sound more like god.
-Compatibility with Grox Archetype mod [custom locale files]
-Captain ranks

1.Titan
2.Titan Champion
3.Titan Overlord
4.Half-God
5.God
6.Omnipotent
7.Creator
8.Glorified
9.Lord of Universe
10.Absolute Perfection


*Welp, the abilities aren't on your spaceship equipment permanentely, they disappear after you exit the game or go to main menu.
To bring them back, you need to buy again (you don't have to buy all of them btw :P)

How to get it? Just start the game from Space Stage - absolute simple :D

-Almighty_Archetype_Mod - The main mod .w.
